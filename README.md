    <summary>Identify missing values</summary>
    In this step, I used the isnull() function from the Pandas library to check for any missing values in the dataset. By calling .sum() on the result, I obtained the total number of missing values for each column. This helped me understand the completeness of the data and identify any columns that might need attention or imputation.

    <summary>Estimate Skewness and Kurtosis</summary>
    I calculated the skewness and kurtosis of the dataset using the skew() and kurtosis() methods from Pandas. Skewness measures the asymmetry of the data distribution, while kurtosis indicates the "tailedness" of the distribution. These metrics provide insights into the nature of the data distributions, helping to assess normality and identify potential outliers.

    <summary>Correlation Heat Map</summary>
    To visualize the relationships between numeric variables, I created a correlation heat map using Seaborn and Matplotlib. First, I filtered the dataset to include only numeric columns and generated a correlation matrix. Then, I plotted the heat map, annotating it with the correlation coefficients. This visualization allowed me to easily identify strong correlations, which are valuable for understanding how different variables interact with each other.

    <summary>Scatter Plot for Different Parameters</summary>
    Describe the scatter plots you generated for various parameters, including any patterns or trends you noticed in the relationships between them.

    <summary>Replace Categorical Values with Numerical Values</summary>
    Discuss the process of converting categorical values into numerical representations (e.g., America = 1, Europe = 2) and the significance of this transformation for analysis.
